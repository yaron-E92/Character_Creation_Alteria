# Character_Creation_Alteria
Update log:
15.9.2017, 18:01 - Changed "character" from a list to a dictionary
and added extra "padding" to the messages showing the chosen input.

18:05 - Fixed something that I just noticed. Added 'c' to the legal list of race input

22:10 - NEW IN V0.2 - Decided to create a 'class' for character, so that it will have the current data and a seperate dictionary for attributes

22:42 - Created a new Instance variable in the 'Character' class: a dictionary of attributes.
